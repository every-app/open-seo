# Cloudflare Self-Hosting

This guide covers:

1. Initial setup after clicking Deploy to Cloudflare
2. How to update to the latest OpenSEO version
3. How to add teammates

## Initial setup

### 1) Deploy from GitHub

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/every-app/open-seo)

Click the deploy button, there are lots of fields on the deploy form, but you only need to do the below steps.

1. Connect your Git provider (GitHub/GitLab).
2. Leave the resource naming fields as default unless you have a reason to change them.
3. Click `Create and Deploy`.
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to finish.

### 2) Configure authentication and secrets

In the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Go to `Compute` -> `Workers & Pages` -> your OpenSEO Worker.
2. Open `Settings`.
3. In `Domains & Routes`, enable `Cloudflare Access` for the `workers.dev` route.
4. Save the values shown by Cloudflare Access.
5. In `Variables & Secrets`, add:
   - `POLICY_AUD` (from Access setup)
   - `TEAM_DOMAIN` (domain from `JWKS_URL`, for example `https://your-team.cloudflareaccess.com`)
   - `DATAFORSEO_API_KEY`

### 3) Optional: add an R2 lifecycle rule

DataForSEO API responses are cached in R2 under the `dataforseo-cache/` prefix. This step is optional, but recommended to automatically clean up expired cache objects:

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket lifecycle add open-seo dataforseo-cache-expiry dataforseo-cache/ --expire-days 7
```

If you changed the R2 bucket name during deploy, replace `open-seo` with your bucket name.

Without a lifecycle rule, cached objects under `dataforseo-cache/` will accumulate indefinitely and increase storage costs over time.

### 4) Validate setup

1. Open your Worker URL again.
2. Sign in with Cloudflare Access.
3. OpenSEO should load after login.

If login fails, re-check the three secrets and Access toggle.

## How to update to the latest OpenSEO version

If your repo was created from the Cloudflare Deploy button, use this flow.

### One-time setup

Run this once in your local repo:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/every-app/open-seo.git
git fetch upstream
```

### Update steps (use every time)

```bash
git fetch upstream
cp wrangler.jsonc wrangler.local.backup.jsonc
git checkout main
git reset --hard upstream/main
cp wrangler.local.backup.jsonc wrangler.jsonc
git add wrangler.jsonc
git commit -m "restore Cloudflare settings" || true
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

Why this is needed:

- `wrangler.jsonc` has your Cloudflare resource IDs.
- The update step keeps your IDs while pulling the newest OpenSEO code.

## Give teammates access to OpenSEO

To let teammates sign in to OpenSEO, update your Cloudflare Access policy.

1. Open Cloudflare Zero Trust.
2. Go to Access -> Applications.
3. Open your OpenSEO application.
4. Edit the `Allow` policy.
5. Add teammate emails (or your company email domain / group).
6. Save.

After saving, teammates can open your OpenSEO URL and sign in through Cloudflare Access.
