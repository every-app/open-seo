/**
 * Returns the AI SDK LanguageModel for the chat agents. `usage: { include: true }`
 * turns on OpenRouter usage accounting so each response carries its real USD
 * cost (providerMetadata.openrouter.usage.cost) — which we meter against the
 * shared usage-credit pool. `provider.order` prefers Together, then Atlas
 * Cloud (fp8); `zdr: true` restricts routing to Zero-Data-Retention endpoints
 * (prompts are never retained), which is the actual constraint — it excludes
 * MiniMax first-party without a hand-maintained allowlist. The account also
 * enforces this ("Non-frontier requires ZDR" data policy); the request-level
 * flag is belt-and-braces so the constraint survives a dashboard change.
 * Fallbacks stay on within the ZDR set because pinning providers caused a
 * prod outage (Jul 2026: Together upstream-rate-limited m3 and every chat
 * turn 429'd); as of Jul 2026 the ZDR set for m3 is Together/AtlasCloud/
 * Novita/Parasail at the same price plus Morph at 2x output as a last resort.
 *
 * `reasoning` turns on OpenRouter's reasoning-token channel so the model's
 * chain-of-thought comes back as a separate reasoning stream instead of
 * leaking into the visible answer text (MiniMax M3 otherwise dumps its
 * `<think>` trace inline). `effort: "medium"` is OpenRouter's default —
 * stated explicitly only because the SDK type requires one once the channel
 * is configured.
